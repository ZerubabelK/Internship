#### Redux should work properly

- Description: Verifies that Redux is working correctly.
- Steps:

  1. Access the Redux store using `cy.getReduxStore()`
     2.Continuation:

  1. Assert that the length of the `tasks` array in the store is 0

#### Should add a task with Redux

- Description: Verifies that a task can be added using Redux.
- Steps:
  1. Access the Redux store using `cy.getReduxStore()`
  1. Assert that the length of the `tasks` array in the store is 0
  1. Dispatch an action to add a task to the store with the payload `{ id: 1, name: "New Task", completed: false }`
  1. Assert that the length of the `tasks` array in the store is 1

#### Should remove a task with Redux

- Description: Verifies that a task can be removed using Redux.
- Steps:
  1. Access the Redux store using `cy.getReduxStore()`
  1. Assert that the length of the `tasks` array in the store is 1
  1. Dispatch an action to delete a task from the store with the payload `1`
  1. Assert that the length of the `tasks` array in the store is 0

#### Should mark a task as completed with Redux

- Description: Verifies that a task can be marked as completed using Redux.
- Steps:
  1. Access the Redux store using `cy.getReduxStore()`
  1. Assert that the length of the `tasks` array in the store is 0

### Conclusion

The test spec verifies the functionality of a task list application using Cypress. It covers various scenarios such as loading the page, adding and removing tasks, marking tasks as completed or incomplete, editing tasks, filtering tasks by status, and testing Redux integration. The tests ensure that the application behaves as expected and that Redux actions and state management are functioning correctly.
